<h1>Fun demo of CSS3 animations that simulate a moving marker</h1>

<h4>Just a bunch of CSS animations:</h4>
<p>The pulsating circles of the marker are a CSS3 animation of three separate circles. The way it travels is a separate animation of its containing div.</p>

<h2>My Playground</h2>

<p>This project is part of my Playground - a collection of fun (and <em>ahem</em>, dare I say it: clever) stuff I made in the past, from jQuery games and plugins to CSS animation tricks.</p>
